The Weather App code allows users to enter a city name and get real-time weather information, including temperature, weather condition, humidity, and air quality (AQI). It uses:
HTML for the structure (input, button, result display).
CSS for styling the layout with a background image and responsive design.
JavaScript to fetch weather data from the WeatherAPI and dynamically display it.
API URL: The app sends a request to the WeatherAPI's endpoint to retrieve weather data for a specified city.
The web updates the weather details based on the city entered, showing them in a clean, centered card layout.
